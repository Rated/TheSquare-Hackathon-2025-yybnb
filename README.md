# Web Application Development Hackathon: Build Your Web Application

Welcome to the **Web Application Development Hackathon**! This repository serves as the base for your project submissions and collaboration throughout the event.

The goal is to develop a functional and innovative web application. Whether you're focusing on **frontend development with API integration**, **backend development**, or working on a **complete web application**, you'll have the freedom to choose your tech stack and demonstrate your skills. Submit your code and collaborate with fellow participants while building exciting, real-world applications.

## Hackathon Details

- **Start Date**: 22-Mar-2025*
- **End Date**: 23-Mar-2025*
- **Deadline for Pull Requests**: 23-Mar-2025*
- **Project Repo Link**:

```
## Preferred Languages and Technologies

- **React JS / NextJS**
- **Python / Flask**

> **Note**: You are free to use any tech stack you're comfortable with, such as Vue.js, Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails, or others. The focus is on building a functional full-stack application.

## Project Overview

Participants are tasked with developing a full-stack web application within the given timeline. You can choose from the following project ideas, or feel free to come up with your own idea. 

You have the flexibility to choose your tech stack based on the following options:

1. **Full-Stack Application with Next.js and Python/Flask**: 
    - You can use **Next.js** for the frontend and **Python/Flask** for the backend. This allows you to build a complete full-stack application.

2. **Frontend with Next.js and Backend with Python**: 
    - You can choose to build the **frontend** with **Next.js** and the **backend** using **Python**. This way, you can create a separate backend and frontend, with both running as independent applications.

3. **Full-Stack with Next.js Only**: 
    - If you prefer, you can create everything with **Next.js**. This includes both the frontend and the backend in a single Next.js application, utilizing its API routes to handle the server-side logic.

For participants choosing to create separate applications for frontend and backend, please structure your code into two separate folders:
- One folder for the frontend (e.g., `frontend/`), and 
- One folder for the backend (e.g., `backend/`).

Each application should have its own **pull request**. Ensure that both repositories (or folders) are properly documented and structured.

## How to Submit

1. **Create a Branch**:
   - Once you have developed your features, create a branch to submit your code.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
2. **Add Contact Information**:
    - Add your contact details (email, phone number, LinkedIn, etc.) in a file named `yourname-README.md` in the root of your project. This will help us contact you if needed.

3. **Create a Project-README.md**:
    - Create a new `README.md` file for your project where you can provide details about what you have developed. Include the following:
        - **Project Description**: A brief overview of the features you implemented.
        - **How to Test the Application**: Provide detailed instructions on how to run and test the application on our system. For example:
            - Dependencies installation (e.g., Node.js, Python packages)
            - Running the application (e.g., `npm start`, `python app.py`)
            - Any specific configurations required (e.g., environment variables)

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added feature: [feature-name]"
     ```

5. **Push Your Branch**:
   - Push your branch to your forked repo:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository and click on the **Pull Request** button to create a pull request to the main repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-commented code.
- **Functionality**: Features implemented as per project requirements.
- **Creativity**: Extra features and unique implementations.
- **UI/UX Design**: User-friendly and visually appealing design.
